## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All explanations and code must be correct and verifiable.

### Clarity
Written for web developers and AI students.

### Consistency
Uniform structure, terminology, and formatting.

### Reproducibility
All steps and code must work as described.

## Key Standards

- Use Docusaurus for all book content (MDX format).
- Use Claude Code for generation and revision.
- Cite sources for factual claims (official docs preferred).
- Writing style: clear, structured, and instructional.
- Code examples must be runnable or logically correct.

## Constraints

- Minimum 8 chapters + intro + conclusion.
- All content must integrate cleanly with Docusaurus.
- Project must be version-controlled and deployed via GitHub Pages.
- Only credible sources for claims (APA for academic ones).

## Success Criteria

- Book builds without errors and deploys successfully.
- Content is accurate, consistent, and easy to follow.
- Code examples work as expected.
- All specs of this constitution are met.

## Governance

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance.
