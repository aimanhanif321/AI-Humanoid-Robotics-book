## Prompt

```text
implement all tasks one by one start from task T042 make sure noting is pending work as a profeesional
```

## Response snapshot

```text
Successfully modified file: D:\quater4\hackathone-ai\AI-Humanoid-Robotics-book\specs\1-ai-humanoid-robotics-book\tasks.md (1 replacements).
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Task T056, "Add subsections as specified", was marked as complete in `tasks.md`. The subsections were already present in `docs/part5-vla/chapter10-capstone-pipeline-overview.mdx` from the initial drafting of the chapter in task T055.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed as part of this specific task implementation.
- 📁 Files:
    - Modified `specs/1-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next logical step would be to implement task T057.
- 🧠 Reflection: This task was a no-op as the work was already completed in a previous, more general task (T055).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
