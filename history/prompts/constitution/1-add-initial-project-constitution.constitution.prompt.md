Clarity: written for web developers and AI students. Consistency: uniform structure, terminology, and formatting. Reproducibility: all steps and code must work as described. Key Standards Use Docusaurus for all book content (MDX format). Use Claude Code for generation and revision. Cite sources for factual claims (official docs preferred). Writing style: clear, structured, and instructional. Code examples must be runnable or logically correct. Constraints Minimum 8 chapters + intro + conclusion. All content must integrate cleanly with Docusaurus. All content must integrate cleanly with Docusaurus. Project must be version-controlled and deployed via GitHub Pages. Only credible sources for claims (APA for academic ones). Success Criteria Book builds without errors and deploys successfully. Content is accurate, consistent, and easy to follow. Code examples work as expected. All specs of this constitution are met. ``` ## Response snapshot ```text The project constitution has been updated to version 1.0.0, reflecting the initial set of principles, standards, and constraints you provided. Manual Follow-up Required: *   Review and update the following templates to align with the new constitution: *   .specify/templates/plan-template.md *   .specify/templates/spec-template.md *   .specify/templates/tasks-template.md *   All command files in .specify/templates/commands/ *   The `RATIFICATION_DATE` in .specify/memory/constitution.md needs to be updated with the original adoption date. Suggested Commit Message: ``` docs: add constitution v1.0.0 (initial principles, standards, constraints) ``` ``` ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Project constitution established. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: 1 file modified (.specify/memory/constitution.md) - 🔁 Next prompts: Review and update dependent templates; Address TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE) - 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the constitution based on user input and generated a sync impact report. Need to ensure dependent templates are updated. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: create-phr.sh script not found, resorted to agent-native file operations. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure create-phr.sh script is available or enhance agent-native PHR creation with ID allocation logic.
